SSH Browser Commands to Run Jon through SSH Browser

—> I am doing this project again, so I don’t forget any commands and when I later on read this file, I can get clear idea of how to do this properly

—> First upload all files recursively in VM local machine or directly upload zip file and unzip it
—> i am gonna upload zip file first
—> unzip folder here by using command ,
unzip my_python_package.zip

—> move to this folder
—> it includes another folder my_package , create a zip file of it as well because this folder includes all python scripts modules that are imported in main.py file
—> to do this, write this command(you should be present in directory where this folder is present)
zip my_package
eg:- zip -r output_filename.zip /path/to/folder
original command :- zip -r my_package /home/jatin_rana_581187_jr/my_python_project

—> now, we have all required files, now let’s upload all these file to bucket
—> write these commands
—> gsutil cp my_package.zip gs://dataproc-staging-us-central1-323213977617-p13ribxq/ (Underline URL is location where we want to store our file in bucket)
(you must be present in directory where this my_package.zip file is present)

—> gsutil cp main.py gs://dataproc-staging-us-central1-323213977617-p13ribxq/
(Underline URL is location where we want to store our file in bucket)
(you must be present in directory where this main.py file is present)

—> now, run main.py script using spark-submit command
spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode client \
  --py-files gs://dataproc-staging-us-central1-323213977617-p13ribxq/my_package.zip \
  gs://dataproc-staging-us-central1-323213977617-p13ribxq/main.py


—> If you are getting this error , then this means that my_package.zip file is not uploaded properly, so you can upload it directly into bucket from local machine(mac), but first you will need to create zip file in mac of “my_pacakge” folder and then upload it on bucket


Now The Task is Done. You can perform same Task on GCP Jobs UI as well

ON GCP UI,
choose region and your cluster and the under
‘Main Class or Jar’ , paste url of main.py file from bucket
and under ‘Additional Python Files’ , paste url of my_package.zip from bucket

and then, click on submit and your job would be successfully running.
